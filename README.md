This is a game for Math Open Day. It was created by SDL2 in C++.
The game may consume a lot of memory due to the fact that the image are all in high resolution.
The idea of the game is very simple, place the water in some cell to contain the fire. Despite the 
simplicity of the idea, the code turned out to be quite long, maybe there are many things that can
be optimized. 
To play the game, you need to download the file from [File](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gFK0X09jtiQ-tbHdz3fUYf0CyvdnWhuq)
Put all file in the directory, and merge the lib directory (for window). The game might be run directly after installing the 
SDL2 library in Linux, I haven't test the game on Mac yet.

To pause the game, use the ESC key.
